In this lab, I researched three different terms: food desert, fast food and diabetes. The share the same topic: Food accessibility and people's health. when search the three different terms, I inputed mutilple parameters to make sure the search result is optimizes. For the food desert, I used parameters "food desert" "desert of food". For the fast food, I used parameters "fast food" "fast-food". For the diabetes, I used "diabetes" "Diabetic ketoacidosis". I used these three different terms to generate three different cloud 

I want to make this comparison because I want to see how the people are talking about these three terms and how their wordcloud are similar to each other. If there are obvious overlap between these 3 wordclouds, that means food desert and fast food can have a corelation with diabetes. Thats what i want to argue: the government should working on programs that eliminate food desert to improve the overall health of people in the U.S. From the word clouds, the words that related to the keywords can be used and analysed to find solutions to these problems. 

## Word Cloud – Diabetes

Above are the 3 word clouds I made. From the Food desert wordcloud, there is a big "Grocery store", that means food desert is created becasue of lack of geocery stores in a certian area,thats also the defination of food desert. You can also see words like "sweet" "dessert" "candy", that may indicates that people living in food desert may have to consume sweet food to gain high calories for survive. Sweet food can cause diabetes. From the fast food wordcloud, i surprising find no similarity with the other 2 wordclouds, the frequent words are 'like' 'subscript' ' more' 'best' and the name of brands of fast food. Most video about fast food are just reviewing and share experience of eating fast food, few have analyse or criticize the impact of health. Thats because fast food is very commomly accpeted and many people like it. From the diabetes wordcloud, the frequent words are 'treatment' 'infomation' 'medical', that means many people are searching video that cure or relief the symptoms of diabetes, that reflects that diabetes is a commom disease and so many peoples with diabetes are searching for help online. 

The possible reasons for the patterns I observed is the fact that there are many food deserts in the U.S., where in the food desert people may eat more sweet food because they are high in energy and easy to buy, they may cause diabete and there are so many people have diabetes in the U.S. and they search online seeking for treatment and solutions. Fast food is popular in the U.S. and there are many videos about people sharing there experience of fast food with less criticize of it. Put them together, the healthy diet is still uncommon in the U.S. and many people are suffering because of unhealthy diet, and they may have no power to change it becasue they may live in food desert where sweet food is the easy option for them to survive. 

My research could be improved by searching more platform instead of just youtube, and I can search more academical platform instead of these social medias for entertainment, to see how different the keyword are toward the same term,how different the the attitude of common people and the academical researcher toward the same term. That will make my study more convincing. 

Something That is different from my expectation is that I expected to see the words such as 'accessibility' 'equity' 'program', but I just did not see them. That may because these terms are too 'formal' that usually does not appear in the 'popular' videos. I am also surprised that the wors related to fast food are msotly positive. I thought there should be more criticize of it.
